# Text-Summarizer-with-WSD
This project is a text summarization system that leverages word sense disambiguation and pre-trained T5 models. It identifies and summarizes repeating words with different meanings, using spaCy for NLP and an n-gram model for candidate word selection. It compares summaries using Rouge scores and outputs the best one. Written in Python with Flask.
